# These variables are injected into the docker build process only. They will not exist in the container.
# You can use them, for example, to set a proxy, or set credentials needed on build time
# The values you set here need to be exposed to the pipeline as environment variables also

# Do not use values with spaces in it. spaces will be stripped during buildtime in Kaniko!
